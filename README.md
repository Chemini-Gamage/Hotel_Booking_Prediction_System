This project predicts whether a hotel booking will be canceled based on customer and booking details. It uses machine learning models to classify bookings, helping hotels manage cancellations more effectively.

Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares data to improve prediction accuracy.
Machine Learning Models: Implements various models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, to predict cancellations.
User Interface: A simple, user-friendly interface where users can enter booking information and get real-time predictions.
Performance Evaluation: The model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC scores.
Technologies:
Python: Core programming language.
Scikit-learn, XGBoost: For building machine learning models.
Pandas, NumPy: For data handling.
Flask/Django (optional): To create the web-based interface.
How to Use:
Clone the repository.
Install the required dependencies.
Run the application, input booking details, and get a prediction on whether the booking is likely to be canceled.
