Techniques Used
Clustering

Goal: To segment hotel guests based on their booking behaviors and preferences, using unsupervised learning techniques.
Model: KMeans Clustering, which groups customers into distinct clusters.
Purpose: Helps in recognizing customer groups and tailoring marketing strategies for each group.
Classification
Goal: To predict guest behaviors such as cancellations and repeat bookings using supervised learning techniques.
Model: Decision Tree with high accuracy.
Purpose: Predicting guest cancellations helps the hotel adjust its operations, improving occupancy rates and minimizing the financial impact of last-minute cancellations.
Machine Learning Models
Clustering:
KMeans: Used for clustering guests into distinct segments based on their booking behavior.
Classification:
Decision Tree: The primary model used for predicting cancellations, with high accuracy.
Other Models Explored:
Random Forest
Extra Trees
Ensemble Learning Methods 
Technologies
Python: Core programming language.
Scikit-learn: For building machine learning models.
Pandas, NumPy: For data preprocessing.
Matplotlib, Seaborn: For data visualization.
